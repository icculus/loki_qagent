This code has been removed from KDE 1.94, in particular the KDE libs
package, and the kdecore library. A variety of scary references to kdebug
have been pulled, so I wouldn't be too terribly surprised if this
occasionally crashes and burns on you. The original author is Christian
Czezakte (e9025461@studet.tuwien.ac.at), who gets a great big "Thank You"
for putting an end to nearly a week of swearing. This code is licensed under
the GNU Library General Public License, and can be found at
ftp://ftp.kde.org.
