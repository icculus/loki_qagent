        -- clean up tags, change to XML format (need to talk to Raf 
first. Getting a book on XML wouldn't hurt either.)
        -- finish Fenris support
        -- finish setupdb support (nearly there, but it seems to have
broken in my absence)
        -- internationalization support
        -- sidebar logo (192x384) (ask Jason)
        -- embedding sidebar logo in EXE?
        -- Qt/Embedded, if it will work...
        -- various code cleanup items (Makefile clean up, build process
cleanup, etc.)
