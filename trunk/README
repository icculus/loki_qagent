This isn't a README so much as an apology. I wrote this mess while I was at
Loki; it was later to be part of something slightly larger, a GL Setup
program for Linux, perhaps, and through a series of confusions, 
misunderstandings, downscalings, upscalings, reroutings, and "dump it on the 
intern", I ended up penning this.

Do what you want with it; I doubt very much that it actually will serve
any actual useful purpose to anybody. I haven't even tried it with the
latest Qt sources yet, and I sort of suspect that if it's like moving from
2.1 to 2.2 was, there will be breakage, panic in the streets, and probably
locusts. The only really good thing in this package is probably the qt_dir/ 
Makefile, which, if you're trying to use Qt for a project, will solve a lot 
of your problems later on.

Cheers,
