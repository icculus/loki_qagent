BEFORE ALPHA:

-- add better tags

AFTER ALPHA:

-- try to overhaul execution mechanism. I would really prefer that all
executions go through one path if that is at all possible..
-- on the server side we should send a confirmation e-mail.
-- better error handling system. (try/catch?)
-- clean out "jump" code. I sort of started this, although the end result is
only a partial improvement. PROBABLY what will happen is that the next() and
back() slots get overwritten with a NULL function, and then everything goes
into pressedNext/etc. In fact, it might be better to rename those functions
and then have them call the parent class. So much shuffling of crap, but
hopefully that would mean we can avoid a LOT of the klunkiness around the
pageOn() thing which is driving me up the wall.
-- move key_name from makefile into host.def to avoid unnecessarily
duplication. Phbbt.
-- dump_file () function
-- internationalization support (means basically ripping 80% of this into
bite size pieces... groan...)
