Loki Entertainment Software Privacy Policy

There will, at some point, be a privacy policy here. When it arrives it will be stored as a word wrapped text file with no newline characters except in those places especially specified.

This is just a test file.

And there should REALLY be a flag to turn off this stuff as well at compile
time... Nnngh! Mmnkgph.
